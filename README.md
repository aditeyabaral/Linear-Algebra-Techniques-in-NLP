# Linear-Algebra-Techniques-in-NLP
A project made as a part of the Linear Algebra course (UE18MA251) at PES University. The objective of the project was to demonstrate the large scale applications of Linear Algebra. The repository contains a well built documentation on basic vector space models, document similarity, topic modelling techniques and text summarization.

All the documentation files are in the root directory and the source code for the various applications can be found in [Code](https://github.com/aditeyabaral/Linear-Algebra-Techniques-in-NLP/tree/master/Code "Code").
